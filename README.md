# nagger
Nag user until he performs some action.

We want to do something like pop up a dialog window when there are overdue actions, the
dialog will have buttons like "did it" and "later". No overdue actions,
no nagging dialog.

For now I will hard-code the "triggers" for naggable actions which will include:
Pay est taxes 4 times a year.
Download bank statments once a (calendar) month.
Pour cleaner down drain every (elapsed) 60 days.
